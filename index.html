  <p>I have had many years of experience and training in the managment field.
    I started my work history in Vega
    Texas plowing and working for my grandad on his farm summer of 1984-1985.
    Summer of 1986 I took my plowing skills to Bryce Cook Farms in Vega Texas. 1987-88
    I spent several summers in the back of a customized combine auger bend sacking
    grass seed.(This is by far the hardest job I have ever had and hope it remains that way!)
